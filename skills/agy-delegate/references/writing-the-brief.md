# Writing the brief

A brief is the entire task as Antigravity will see it. It runs in a separate conversation with **no
memory of your conversation, no access to your prior notes, and no shared context** - only the text you
send and whatever it can inspect in the workspace. If a constraint is not in the brief or discoverable
in the repo, it does not exist for Antigravity.

## Model choice

`agy` has a configured default model, so a fresh dispatch does not require `--model`. Pass `--model`
only when the human has named a preferred Antigravity model label for this task. `agy models` shows the
available labels.

A resumed run keeps the conversation context. Send only the delta brief.

## The shape that works

Antigravity responds well to compact, block-structured prompts with XML tags rather than long prose.
State the task, what "done" looks like, how to behave by default, and the few constraints that actually
matter. Add a block only when the task needs it.

```xml
<task>
One or two sentences: the concrete job and where it lives. Then the specifics - current state, what to
change, and explicitly what to leave untouched. The "leave untouched" list is what keeps Antigravity
from wandering into unrelated refactors.
</task>

<verification_loop>
Run these before finishing and fix anything they surface, don't just report it:
  <the project's real test command>
  <the project's real lint/format command>
  <the project's real build/typecheck command>
Confirm the working tree shows only the intended changes afterward.
</verification_loop>

<action_safety>
Keep changes scoped to the task. No unrelated refactors, renames, or cleanup unless required for
correctness. Do NOT run git add or git commit - the orchestrator commits after reviewing. Leave the
work uncommitted in the working tree.
</action_safety>

<structured_output_contract>
End with a report in this exact shape:
  1. What changed and why
  2. Files touched
  3. Gate outcomes (paste the test/lint counts)
  4. Anything you deviated on, left open, or want a decision on
</structured_output_contract>
```

That four-block skeleton covers most implementation tasks. Reach for extra blocks when the task profile
calls for them:

- **Debugging / open-ended fixes** - add `<completeness_contract>` (resolve fully, don't stop at the
  first plausible fix) and `<missing_context_gating>` (don't guess missing repo facts; find them or
  state what's unknown).
- **Research / recommendations** - add `<research_mode>` (separate observed facts, inferences, open
  questions).

## Always ask for the report explicitly

The relay captures `agy --print` stdout as `finalMessage`. If Antigravity finishes without a closing
summary, the result is not useful to review. The `<structured_output_contract>` block is what guarantees
a report you can read.

## Discover the real gates

`<verification_loop>` is only useful if it names the project's *actual* commands. Read the repo's
`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `Makefile` / `package.json` first and copy the real ones in (`make test`,
`npm run lint`, `cargo test`, `pytest -q`, whatever it is). A brief that says "run the tests" without
naming them gets you an implementer that guesses - or skips.

## Honor the repo's conventions

If the project has house rules in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or a similar file, restate the load-bearing
ones in the brief. Antigravity can inspect the workspace, but compliance is more reliable when the
important rules are directly in front of it.

## One task per brief

Keep each brief to a single, bounded job. "Review this, fix what you find, update the docs, and suggest
a roadmap" produces a muddled run; split it into separate dispatches. One brief -> one Antigravity run
-> one commit keeps review and rollback clean.

## A worked example

```xml
<task>
In the payments service at services/billing/, the refund path double-charges when a refund is retried
after a network timeout. Make refund submission idempotent: check for an existing refund by idempotency
key before creating a new one. Touch only services/billing/refund.py and its tests. Leave the charge
path, API routes, and data models untouched.
</task>

<verification_loop>
Run and make green before finishing:
  pytest tests/billing/ -q
  ruff check services/billing/
Confirm git status shows only refund.py and its test file changed.
</verification_loop>

<action_safety>
Scope strictly to the refund idempotency fix. No unrelated refactors. Do NOT git add or commit; leave
changes in the working tree for review.
</action_safety>

<structured_output_contract>
Report: (1) the root cause and your fix, (2) files touched, (3) pytest + ruff outcomes with counts,
(4) anything you left open or want decided.
</structured_output_contract>
```

Send this with `relay.mjs` (see [dispatch-and-poll.md](dispatch-and-poll.md)); review the result and
commit it yourself (see [review-and-land.md](review-and-land.md)).
