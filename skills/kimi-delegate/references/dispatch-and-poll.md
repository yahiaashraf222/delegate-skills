# Dispatch and poll

`scripts/relay.mjs` wraps Kimi's headless prompt mode, captures its structured stream, and writes a
`result.json`. Run one command, then read one file.

## Before the first run

```bash
command -v kimi
kimi --version
kimi login
```

Install with `brew install kimi-code` on macOS/Linux or use a native installer from the
[official Kimi Code documentation](https://moonshotai.github.io/kimi-code/en/). `kimi login` uses a
device-code flow without opening the TUI; `/login` is also available inside the TUI.

## Dispatching

```bash
node "<skill-dir>/scripts/relay.mjs" --brief brief.txt --cd /path/to/repo
```

`<skill-dir>` is the installed folder containing this skill's `SKILL.md`.

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--brief <file>` | Brief path. Omit it to read the brief from stdin. |
| `--cd <dir>` | Working root and child process cwd (default: current directory). |
| `--model <alias>` | Kimi model alias for this run (default: Kimi's own `default_model`). |
| `--session <id>` | Resume a specific Kimi session; send only the delta brief. |
| `--resume-last` | Resume the most recent Kimi session for this cwd (`kimi --continue`); send only the delta brief. |
| `--add-dir <dir>` | Add an extra workspace directory. Repeatable. Edits there are not reported in `touchedFiles`. |
| `--timeout <dur>` | Relay watchdog (default: `30m`; h/m/s strings). Kimi has no timeout flag. |
| `--out-dir <dir>` | Artifact directory (default: a fresh directory under the system temp dir). |
| `-h`, `--help` | Print the relay's header help. |

`--session` and `--resume-last` are mutually exclusive. The child cwd pins the primary workspace;
`--add-dir` adds extra workspaces only.

Headless `-p` mode always uses Kimi's auto permission mode. Kimi rejects `--prompt` combined with
`--yolo`, `--auto`, or `--plan`, so the relay passes no autonomy flags and has no `--read-only` or
`--full-access` option. Inspect `touchedFiles` and the diff after every run.

## Artifacts and result fields

Artifacts live outside the repo by default, so they do not appear in `touchedFiles`; an `--out-dir`
inside the worktree can make the artifacts appear there:

- `brief.txt` - the exact brief.
- `events.jsonl` - raw Kimi stdout events.
- `final.txt` - assistant text joined with a blank line between chunks; absent if none was emitted.
- `stderr.txt` - complete stderr.
- `result.json` - the stable `delegate-relay.result.v1` contract.

`result.json` fields:

- `schema`, `tool` (`"kimi"`), `status` (`completed` | `failed` | `kimi_unavailable`), `exitCode`, and
  `signal` (`null` unless the child died on a signal).
- `workdir`, `model` (the model alias or `null`), `resumed`, `kimiVersion`, `sessionId`, `startedAt`,
  and `finishedAt`.
- `briefPath`, `finalPath`, `eventsPath`, and `stderrPath`.
- `finalMessage` - assistant `content` strings joined with `"\n\n"`; tool calls and tool results are
  excluded.
- `touchedFiles` - `git status --porcelain` lines for the **final working tree under `--cd` only**,
  not an attribution of Kimi's edits: anything already dirty before dispatch shows up too, and edits
  Kimi makes inside `--add-dir` workspaces do not show up at all - inspect those trees yourself.
  Dispatch from a clean tree when you want the list to read as "what Kimi changed". `null` means git
  could not report; `[]` means git ran and the tree is clean.
- `stderrTail` - the last 20 non-empty stderr lines on failure.
- `error` - present for launch failures or when the relay watchdog fires.

Kimi's stream carries no token usage, so `result.json` has no `usage` field.

## Waiting for completion

The helper blocks. Use the orchestrator's background-command facility, or background it in a shell and
poll for `result.json`. The run is done only when the process exits and the file contains a `status`.

A pre-run usage error exits 2 and writes no result. A missing `kimi` exits 127 and writes
`status: "kimi_unavailable"`.

## When a run misbehaves

- **`status: "kimi_unavailable"` (exit 127):** install the native Kimi Code CLI, authenticate with
  `kimi login`, and re-dispatch.
- **`status: "failed"`:** read `stderrTail`, `stderrPath`, and the tail of `events.jsonl`. A common
  cause is an unconfigured model alias: `error: failed to run prompt: config.invalid: Model "<x>" is not configured in config.toml…`
- **`status: "failed"` with `signal: "SIGKILL"`:** the host killed the process, commonly through the
  OOM killer or a supervisor timeout. This is not a Kimi error; check host memory and re-dispatch, or
  split the task into smaller briefs.
- **Watchdog failure:** `error` reads
  `kimi did not finish within --timeout <dur>; killed by the relay watchdog`. Increase `--timeout` or
  split the task. The relay sends SIGTERM, waits 10 seconds, then sends SIGKILL if needed.
- **Empty `finalMessage`:** inspect `touchedFiles` and the diff. Add a
  `<structured_output_contract>` to the next brief to require a closing report.

## What the relay runs

The argv is equivalent to:

```bash
kimi --output-format stream-json [--model <alias>] [--session <id> | --continue] \
  [--add-dir <dir> ...] --prompt=<brief>
```

The prompt rides argv and is visible in the host process list. The relay rejects briefs over 120 KB
before launch because the OS caps a single argument. It spawns the native `kimi` binary directly with
the selected `--cd` as cwd; no shell or Kimi timeout flag is involved.

## The commit boundary

The relay never commits. Kimi edits the working tree; the orchestrator reviews, re-runs the gates, and
commits. See [review-and-land.md](review-and-land.md).
