# Writing the brief

A brief is the entire task as Kimi will see it. It runs in a separate session with **no memory of your
conversation, no access to prior notes, and no shared context** - only the text you send and whatever
it can inspect in the workspace. If a constraint is not in the brief or discoverable in the repo, it
does not exist for Kimi.

## Model choice and resumed sessions

Kimi uses `default_model` from its `config.toml`, so a fresh dispatch does not require `--model`. Pass
`--model <alias from your kimi config>` only when the human wants one of their configured model
aliases. Do not invent an alias.

A resumed run keeps the session context. Send only the delta brief with `--resume-last` or
`--session <id>`.

## The shape that works

Use a compact, block-structured brief. State the task, what done means, the few constraints that
matter, and the report Kimi must return.

```xml
<task>
One or two sentences: the concrete job and where it lives. Then the specifics - current state, what to
change, and explicitly what to leave untouched. The leave-untouched list prevents unrelated refactors.
</task>

<verification_loop>
Run these before finishing and fix anything they surface, do not just report it:
  <the project's real test command>
  <the project's real lint/format command>
  <the project's real build/typecheck command>
Confirm the working tree shows only the intended changes afterward.
</verification_loop>

<action_safety>
Keep changes scoped to the task. No unrelated refactors, renames, or cleanup unless required for
correctness. Do NOT run git add or git commit - the orchestrator commits after reviewing. Leave the
work uncommitted in the working tree.
</action_safety>

<structured_output_contract>
End with a report in this exact shape:
  1. What changed and why
  2. Files touched
  3. Gate outcomes (include test/lint counts)
  4. Anything you deviated on, left open, or want a decision on
</structured_output_contract>
```

Add extra blocks only when the task needs them:

- **Debugging or open-ended fixes** - add `<completeness_contract>` (resolve fully, not just the first
  plausible cause) and `<missing_context_gating>` (find missing repo facts or state what is unknown).
- **Research or recommendations** - add `<research_mode>` (separate observed facts, inferences, and
  open questions).

## Always ask for the report explicitly

The relay builds `finalMessage` from assistant text in Kimi's structured stream. Without a closing
summary, the edits may exist but the result is hard to review. The `<structured_output_contract>`
block makes the expected report explicit.

## Discover the real gates

Read the repo's `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `Makefile`, `package.json`, or equivalent first and copy the
actual commands into `<verification_loop>`. A brief that says only "run the tests" makes the
implementer guess or skip them.

## Honor repo conventions

Restate the load-bearing house rules in the brief. Kimi can inspect the workspace, but the important
constraints should be directly in front of it.

## One task per brief

Keep each brief bounded. One brief -> one Kimi run -> one reviewed commit keeps the diff and rollback
clean. Split mixed implementation, review, documentation, and roadmap requests into separate
dispatches.

## A worked example

```xml
<task>
In the payments service at services/billing/, the refund path double-charges when a refund is retried
after a network timeout. Make refund submission idempotent: check for an existing refund by idempotency
key before creating a new one. Touch only services/billing/refund.py and its tests. Leave the charge
path, API routes, and data models untouched.
</task>

<verification_loop>
Run and make green before finishing:
  pytest tests/billing/ -q
  ruff check services/billing/
Confirm git status shows only refund.py and its test file changed.
</verification_loop>

<action_safety>
Scope strictly to the refund idempotency fix. No unrelated refactors. Do NOT git add or commit; leave
changes in the working tree for review.
</action_safety>

<structured_output_contract>
Report: (1) the root cause and fix, (2) files touched, (3) pytest and ruff outcomes with counts,
(4) anything left open or needing a decision.
</structured_output_contract>
```

## Argv delivery limits

Kimi headless mode requires the brief as a command-line argument. The relay reads a file or stdin for
convenience, then passes the text with `--prompt=<brief>`. The equals form binds a brief that starts
with `-` instead of treating it as another flag.

This has two consequences:

- The brief is visible in the host process list (`ps`, `/proc`). Keep secrets out of it on shared
  machines; reference workspace files or environment variables instead.
- A brief over 120 KB is rejected before launch because operating systems cap a single argv value.
  Put large context in the workspace and tell Kimi which file to read.

Dispatch with [dispatch-and-poll.md](dispatch-and-poll.md), then review and commit with
[review-and-land.md](review-and-land.md).
